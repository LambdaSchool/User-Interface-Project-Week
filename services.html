				<div class="content-title">Pre-Construction</div>
				<div class="content-description">services are used in planning a construction project before the actual
					construction begins. These services are often referred to as preconstruction or precon.
					<br><br>
					Often the early feasibility, studies, and design development is supported by construction cost estimators, who
					prepare cost estimates for use in the decision-making process. This process starts with planning, and is supported
					by conceptual or order-of-magnitude estimates. Design then starts with a schematic design (SD) stage, followed by
					a design development (DD) stage, and culminates in a construction document (CD) state.

				<div class="content-title">Construction</div>
				<div class="content-description">is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure.[1] Construction
					differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a
					designated purchaser, while construction typically takes place on location for a known client.[2] Construction as
					an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries.[3] Construction
					starts with planning, design, and financing; it continues until the project is built and ready for use.

				<div class="content-title">Design Build</div>
				<div class="content-description">(or design/build, and abbreviated D–B or D/B accordingly) is a project delivery
					system used in the construction industry. It is a method to deliver a project in which the design and construction
					services are contracted by a single entity known as the design–builder or design–build contractor. It can be
					subdivided into architect-led design–build (ALDB, sometimes known as designer-led design–build) and contractor-led
					design–build.

				<div class="content-title">Sustainability</div>
				<div class="content-description">is architecture that seeks to minimize the negative environmental impact of
					buildings by efficiency and moderation in the use of materials, energy, and development space and the ecosystem at
					large. Sustainable architecture uses a conscious approach to energy and ecological conservation in the design of
					the built environment.[1]
					<br><br>
					The idea of sustainability, or ecological design, is to ensure that our actions and decisions today do not inhibit
					the opportunities of future generations.
