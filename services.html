							<h2>Pre-Construction</h2>
							<p class="p1">This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. You can do anything your heart can imagine. Just let these leaves jump off the brush Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.</p>
							<p class="p2">Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. Let's have a nice tree right here. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.</p>

							<h2>Construction</h2>
							<p class="p1">A beautiful little sunset. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. Just use the old one inch brush. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky.</p>
							<p class="p2">You can do it. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. Let's have a happy little tree in here.

							<p class="p1">Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. That's a son of a gun of a cloud.</p>
							<p class="p2">We wash our brush with odorless thinner. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.</p>

							<p class="p2">Do an almighty painting with us. Use what you see, don't plan it. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. There are no limits in this world. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is.</p>
