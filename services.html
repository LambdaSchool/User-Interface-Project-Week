							<p>Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Be brave. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen.</p>
							<p>We'll play with clouds today. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas.</p>

								<p>Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. You're meant to have fun in life. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. See there how easy that is. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.</p>
								<p>I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.</p>

								<p>We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Anything you want to do you can do here.</p>
