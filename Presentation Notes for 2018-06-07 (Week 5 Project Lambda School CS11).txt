1. What was the most fun part of this project?
    A: The most fun part about this project was getting to the point of solving each design or functionality problem.
    It really helped me to have more "at-bats" to tackle my understanding of what we've learned in the past 4 weeks prior.
    I think by constantly asking myself, "What is the next thing that I need to do?" and "How can I accomplish that?" helped me to take each problem one thing at a time instead of looking at the entire project and feeling overwhelmed by everything that I had not completed yet. 

What was the most difficult part of this project?
    A: Getting things done. I felt like I didn't really hit my stride on getting a solid pace with this project until today, when I worked on completing my mobile views for the services and the contact pages. 
    Waiting on my computer to load Perfect Pixel also ate up a lot of my time.
    (There were a lot of times when I'd refreshed my page to see a change, not had Perfect Pixel load at the same time, and then went to my extensions to click on starting it again, every time I refreshed. This took probably 4 seconds each refresh, and I feel like I refreshed at least 2000 times, so that's roughly 2h13m of my time spent in the past 4 days clicking and waiting to see my changes happen, which I know could have been better).

    2h13m out of 29h? That's 7.66% of my time spent on the whole project just to click on the extension and wait. :(
