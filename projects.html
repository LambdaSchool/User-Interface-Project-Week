                        <p>The works included the construction of basement, ground and third floor (mansard roof) extensions to substantially increase the size of the property. We designed a bespoke kitchen and other built-in furniture to meet the exact requirements of the owner. The house also boasts air-conditioning, digitally-controlled lighting systems, stone and parquet floors, under-floor heating and an extensive, integrated audio-visual system all discreetly installed without compromise to the building's historic character. To the rear of the property a double garage was constructed with a green, wild-meadow roof and the garden was landscaped by our friends at Herald Nicholson Associates (www.heraldnicholson.co.uk).</p>

                        <p>The works included the construction of ground floor, mansard roof and basement level extensions. The extension at basement level spans the entire length of the site forming a playroom with a wine store and boiler room beneath the rear garden and two guest suites, utility room and family sitting room beneath the original house. Light was brought into the basement by lightwells in the front and rear gardens and a two storey lightwell located in the heart of the property. All the fittings in the property were stripped out and the interior was re-planned to suit the client?s wish for a contemporary, open-plan home. The works included the installation of new kitchens, bathrooms, under-floor heating, audio-visual system and digitally controlled lighting.</p>

                        <p>The works included the construction of a large ground floor extension and the addition of a large, new first floor to more than double the size of the original bungalow. The owner of the house is a master joiner whom we have worked with over a number of years to create beautiful bespoke joinery for other projects. During the remodelling of his home, we worked collaboratively to design the bespoke joinery made in his workshop, including the hardwood windows, doors, semi-cantilevered staircase, hand-made kitchen and bathroom joinery. Further examples of his work can be seen at www.arbjoinery.co.uk</p>

                        <p>The work included the construction of a rooftop extension designed to complement the existing Victorian wing and containing a modern guest suite with superb views across London and towards the River Thames. General modernisation of the building included the installation of bespoke bathroom suites, home cinema, gymnasium, new cantilevered stone staircase, air conditioning and an integrated hi-fi and audio visual installation throughout. The minimalist, contemporary interior provides an elegant contrast with the traditional character of the original listed building, which was carefully and sensitively restored.</p>

                        <p>The construction of a rear-side extension created a large, open-plan family room to the rear of the property with easy access into the south-facing garden. The kitchen was located in the heart of the ground floor lit by an internal atrium with a glazed roof. A separate reception room was retained at the front of the house for use as a study/music room/playroom. The works included the installation of a new kitchen and bathrooms, under-floor heating, bespoke joinery, discreet surround sound cinema speakers and digitally controlled lighting system.</p>

                        <p>Situated on a site within the grounds of a large garden centre, the property was no longer viewed as a desirable family residence. It had been vacant for more than 10 years and was in a very poor state of repair. The day nursery has breathed new life into the building and the works included the restoration of all original features, including a very attractive 500 year old oak frame. The new extension provides additional childcare space and a modern kitchen. Additionally, new mechanical and electrical services were installed, including an air conditioning system to control the heating and cooling of all the principal rooms.</p>
