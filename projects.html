				Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? If you hypnotize it, it will go away. We need a shadow side and a highlight side.</br>
				All those little son of a guns. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Let's make a nice big leafy tree.</br>
				I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.
			</p>

			<p class="paragraph">
				Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. You need the dark in order to show the light. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it.</br>
				A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things.<br>
				Trees grow however makes them happy. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. It’s about to freeze me to death. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first.</br>
			</p>

			<p class="paragraph">
				Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet.</br>
				Let's build some happy little clouds up here. Let that brush dance around there and play. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things</br>
				Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. You are only limited by your imagination.</br>
				The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Let's do that again.</br>
			</p>

			<p class="paragraph">
				Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. And maybe a little bush lives there.</br>
				Isn't that fantastic? You can just push a little tree out of your brush like that. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it.</br>
				I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. We'll put some happy little leaves here and there.</br>
			</p>

			<p class="paragraph"> 
				It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful sky? Look at them little rascals. Let all these things just sort of happen. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red.</br>
				Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. In your world you have total and absolute power. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy.</br>
				There it is. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. This is unplanned it really just happens.</br>
