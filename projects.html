				<h2>Hanging Gardens of Babylon</h2>
				<br>
				<p> After overseeing the Ishtar Gate our first full project can be traced back to Babylonian times. Our founding fathers lineage can be traced back to the designers of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.
					Under orders from king Nebuchadnezzar II our design would go down in history as one of the Seven Wonders of the world.

				<h2>Aspen Art Museum</h2>
				<br>
				<p>The $45 million Aspen Art Museum  includes half a dozen galleries, an artist residency area, education spaces, and conservation studios, occupying a total 33,000 square feet. A rooftop garden functions as entrance hall, public gathering area, and outdoor projection space.
					 From the roof-deck sculpture garden, visitors will enjoy unparalleled vistas of Aspen’s environment and the only unobstructed
					public rooftop view of Ajax Mountain. This and more would win our firm the The Pritzker Architecture Prize.

				<h2>Future Hotel Concept</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Bold, bio-inspired, vertical and sustainable: those are the traits that architecture of the future will share, with S & J leading the way.
				   This design makes use of a beautiful water-filled quarry innovative design which features a green roof, geothermal energy and underwater areas including a restaurant and guest rooms. The
				quarry provides an ideal setting for sports and leisure including swimming, water sports, rock climbing and bungee jumping.
