          <h3>Jesse Armitage, London</h3>
          <p>
            Since I started using Water My Plants, my garden has transformed. It
            takes away all of the stress associated with managing water
            schedules of different plants so I can focus on enjoying my garden.

          <h3>Simon Barnes, Huddersfield</h3>
          <p>
            I've been so happy with WMP that I've got my two sons, three
            friends, and my postman using it! Whose next?
          </p>

        <div class="testimonial-3">
          <h3>Maria Tensey, Edinburgh</h3>
          <p>
            Now that both myself and my wife get alerts from Water My Plants, we
            can easily decide whose doing what, and when.

          <h3>Tate Modena, Chesterfield</h3>
          <p>
            If you're not already using Water My Plants, you should almost
            certainly consider it. Even as a dedicated and experienced gardener,
            I've found myself forgetting what's been watered and when. This
            breeds an organised approach that just can't fail.
